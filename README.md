# Old Woman Creek Project Report
This repository includes the main text of the report (project_report.pdf) and a Rmd file documenting the computation process.  The knitted pdf file is too large for GitHub.  The knitted file and all data sets are on Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LhchK9vWtI8PPMKBAbRmRA4SWU7g8_ZO).
