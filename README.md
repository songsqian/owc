# Old Woman Creek Project Report
This repository includes two topics. 

(1) An empirical model for modeling OWC water level changes as a function of selected meteorological variables.  This predictive model was used to project water level changes in response to anticipated climate change.  The project is reported in a Master's thesis (Godre 2020).  the main text of the report (project_report.pdf) and a Rmd file documenting the computation process.  
(2) A Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework for estimating wetland phosphorus retention capacity.  This project presents a process for combining information from different wetlands using the Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework.  The repository includes data and R Markdown documents for data processing, initial hierarchical model (for generating an informative prior), and a Bayesian nonlinear regression model for estimating wetland-specific P loading threshold.  This repository also includes a simulation algorithm for (conservative) sample size estimation.
